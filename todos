finish data cleanup
- raw data for nazmus and phytochrome_exp
- convert time to UTC

log other stuff
- average area
- merge new vision pipeline first., seg mask, bounding boxes

UPDATE SPREADSHEET AGENT TO CONVERT FROM LOCAL TO UTC

modify collector to log appropriately.

consistent action logging, we always should log the 6D action, but maybe also log the agent_action
