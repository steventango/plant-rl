#  Experiment E2 -- Run a learning agent in PlantGrowthChamberBinary
##  Phase P0
### Objectives:
- Test out the rlglue interface over extended time periods (30 minutes * 3 seeds
  * 4 agents = 6 hours).
- See if the agent can learn a simple bandit problem: keep the light on.
### Methods:
- PlantGrowthChamberBinary
  - State: constant 1
  - Action: [off, on]
    - on uses pre-defined reference light spectrum
  - Reward: larger if the image is bright versus dark
    - The reward is the mean of the image RGB values normalized to [0,1]
- Constant Agent
- Greedy Actor-Critic with Planning Agent (GACP)
- Greedy Actor-Critic Agent (GAC)
- Random Agent
- We did not do hyper sweeps, we manually set the hyperparameters for GACP and used
  the same hyperparameters for GAC.
### Observations:
- picamzero has a halting problem, where after 5-56 images it locks up the
  thread and stops working
- Switching to picamera2 seemed to fix the halting problem (100+ images work fine)
- Random agent is not able to learn to keep the light on.
- GAC seems to be able to learn to keep the light on.
- GACP seems to also be able to learn to keep the light on.
- GACP and GAC perform similarly.
### Conclusions & Outlooks:
- Planning is not necessary for this simple bandit problem.
- Hyperparameter search will be a challenge.
